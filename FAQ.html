	<h1>This is the FAQ page.</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><h2>Q: How did you create these songs?</h2>
		<p>A: I use a program called Fruity Loops Studio. It's a full music studio program, available for Windows, that allows you to create beautiful works of music. The songs I have created are merely extremely amateur fumblings with the demo version of this program. I highly suggest you check it out if you are interested in digital music composition.</li>
		<li><h2>Q: Why did you write these songs?</h2>
		<p>A: It's just a hobby of mine. Sometimes some cool tune will pop into my head, and I'll get the urge to create a song out of it. A day or two later, you'll see a new addition to my album.</p>
		<li><h2>Q: What if I have a question you didn't answer here?</h2>
		<p>A: Refer to my Contact page for information on how to contact me in order to ask me any additional questions you might have.</p>
